Web application developed with JavaScript and
Firebase, which allows users to keep track of their
expenses. The application has a main page that
displays a list of the user's expenses, organised by
date and category. The user can add new expenses
by clicking on the "Add expense" button and
completing a form with the expense information,
such as amount, date and category. In addition, the
application has a filter that allows the user to view
expenses by specific date and category. The
ExpenseLogs application is a good example of how
React and Firebase can be used to create a useful
and efficient web application that helps the user
keep track of their expenses.
