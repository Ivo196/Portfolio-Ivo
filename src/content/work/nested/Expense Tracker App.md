### Expense Tracker Vite
> Vite - React - Tailwind

Contains an expense tracking application developed with React. Expense tracking is a common practice to control and manage personal or business expenses.

The Expense Tracker React application allows users to record and track their expenses. By cloning and running the application, users can add different expense categories and record the details of each transaction, such as the amount spent, the date and an optional description. The application provides an intuitive user interface that displays recorded expenses, organizes them by category, and provides an overview of total expenses.

In addition, this application uses key React concepts, such as components, state and props, to create a dynamic and easy-to-use user interface. It also makes use of additional tools and libraries, such as react-router-dom for navigation between different pages and local storage for storing expense data in the user's browser.

In summary, the Expense Tracker React application is a basic expense tracking tool developed with React, which allows users to record and track their personal or business expenses efficiently.
