### Login App
> React - Firebase - Tailwind

Web application developed with React and Firebase,
which allows the user to authenticate and login to
the application using their email and password. The
application uses Firebase Authentication to manage
user authentication and store user information such
as email and password. Firebase is also used to store
and synchronise real-time data in the cloud, which
facilitates the creation of scalable and efficient web
applications.
