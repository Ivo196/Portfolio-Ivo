### Convolutional Neural Networks CNN - Deep-Learning
> Deep Learning - CNN  

Focused on implementing a new or updated version of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. This script likely includes the architecture definition, training procedures, and possibly enhancements or optimizations over previous versions for better performance in tasks such as image recognition or classification. 

For more details, you can review the script directly on the GitHub page.
