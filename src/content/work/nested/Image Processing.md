### Image Processing - Visualization
> Jupyter - Computer Vision  

Discusses computational perception activities, which could involve understanding how computers interpret images or visual data. This might include techniques for image analysis, processing, and the algorithms behind how machines perceive and analyze visual information to mimic human vision in some aspects. 

For detailed insights, you would need to review the document directly on the GitHub repository.
