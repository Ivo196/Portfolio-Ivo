### Drag&Drop App
> React - Vite 

Contains a sample project to implement drag and drop functionality in a web application using React.

Drag and drop is a technique that allows users to interact with elements on a web page by moving them from one place to another using the mouse or touch screen. This functionality is commonly used in file management applications, task boards, image editors and many other interactive web applications.

In the specific case of this project, React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is used along with other dependencies such as React Beautiful DND (Drag and Drop) to implement drag and drop functionality in a simple way.
