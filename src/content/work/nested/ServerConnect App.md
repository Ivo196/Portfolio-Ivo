### ServerConnect App
> Next Js

The project in question contains an implementation of a server connection using the Next.js library.

Next.js is a React web development framework that allows you to create single-page web applications (SPA) or multi-page applications (MPA) efficiently. It provides advanced features such as server-side rendering (SSR), static page generation and server-side routing.

The goal of the project is to provide a solution for establishing a connection to a server using Next.js. The code provides a basic structure and implementation examples for connecting a Next.js application to an external server, such as a REST API.
