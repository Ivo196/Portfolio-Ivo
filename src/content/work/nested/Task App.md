### Tasks App
> React - Tailwind

Web application developed with React, which allows
the user to create and manage tasks (To-do List).
The application has several functionalities, such as
adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed,
deleting tasks, filtering tasks by status (completed or
pending), among others. In addition, the application
uses localStorage to store the user's tasks, so the
data is maintained even if the browser tab is closed
or the computer is restarted.
